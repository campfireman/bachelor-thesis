  abstract = {This paper presents Abalearn, a self-teaching Abalone pro- gram capable of automatically reaching an intermediate level of play without needing expert-labeled training examples or deep searches. Our approach is based on a reinforcement learning algorithm that is risk- seeking, since defensive players in Abalone tend to never end a game. We extend the risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework in order to deal with large state spaces and we also propose a set of features that seem relevant for achieving a good level of play. We evaluate our approach using a fixed heuristic opponent as a bench- mark, pitting our agents against human players online and comparing samples of our agents at dierent times of training.},

High branching factors and the need for looking deeper in game trees are overwhelming, even for today's high performance PC's. Therefore, better game-plays are only available with better algorithms and heuristics for an ordinary player, not with faster machines. Abalone is a recent two-person strategy game. Initial evaluations point out that the branching factor is larger than the chess. In this paper, a new heuristic used by a simple intelligent agent for playing Abalone game, named as ABLA is introduced. ABLA's performance is promising as compared to existing computerized Abalone players.},

For perfect information games with relatively low branching factor for their decision tree (such as Chess, Checkers etc.) and a highly accurate evaluation function, Alpha-Beta search proved to be far more efficient than Monte Carlo Tree Search. In recent years many new techniques have been developed to improve the efficiency of the Alpha-Beta tree, applied to a variety of scientific fields. This paper explores several techniques for increasing the efficiency of Alpha-Beta Search on the board game of Abalone while introducing some new innovative techniques that proved to be very effective. The main idea behind them is the incorporation of probabilistic features to the otherwise deterministic AlphaBeta search.},

  abstract = {A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100\textendash 0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. Starting from zero knowledge and without human data, AlphaGo Zero was able to teach itself to play Go and to develop novel strategies that provide new insights into the oldest of games. To beat world champions at the game of Go, the computer program AlphaGo has relied largely on supervised learning from millions of human expert moves. David Silver and colleagues have now produced a system called AlphaGo Zero, which is based purely on reinforcement learning and learns solely from self-play. Starting from random moves, it can reach superhuman level in just a couple of days of training and five million games of self-play, and can now beat all previous versions of AlphaGo. Because the machine independently discovers the same fundamental principles of the game that took humans millennia to conceptualize, the work suggests that such principles have some universal character, beyond human bias.},
