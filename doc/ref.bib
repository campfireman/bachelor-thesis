  abstract = {N\aa r Deepminds AlphaGo-program slo den menneskelige profesjonelle Go-spilleren Fan Hui i 2015 var dette et stort gjennombrudd for kunstig intelligens til spilling. Go hadde vist seg \aa{} motst\aa{} de teknikkene som lenge hadde sl\aa tt mennesker i spill som sjakk. Gjennom en nyskapende kombinasjon av dype nevrale nettverk, forsterkende l\ae ring og Monte Carlo-tres\o k ble Go endelig mestret. Kort tid etterp\aa{} kom AlphaGo Zero, som oppn\aa dde det samme ved \aa{} l\ae re utelukkende ved \aa{} spille mot seg selv, og AlphaZero, som generaliserte teknikken til andre spill. Dette arbeidet inneholder en n\o ye gjennomgang av disse systemene og arbeidet i feltet som ledet opp mot dem. Det g\aa r gjennom min egen implementasjon av denne teknikken og dens bruk i spillene Hex og Othello. Ved hjelp av denne implementasjonen har jeg unders\o kt rollen utrulling spiller i algoritmen. Dette var en sentral del av tidligere arbeid i feltet og fremdeles brukt i AlphaGo, men ikke i AlphaGo Zero og AlphaZero. Flere eksperimenter har blitt gjennomf\o rt for \aa{} f\aa{} empiriske data for om utrulling fremdeles kan v\ae re en gunstig del av denne nyskapende kombinasjonen av teknikker, og hvordan disse i s\aa{} fall b\o r gjennomf\o res. Selv om det var noen indikasjoner i dataene p\aa{} at utrulling har liten eller ingen positiv effect er disse resultatene stort sett ikke entydige. Noen svakheter i oppsettet har blitt identifisert og noen nye sp\o rsm\aa l har blitt oppdaget. Men arbeidet har resultert i et funksjonelt system som kan brukes til videre unders\o kelser av problemomr\aa det og enten gi mer entydige data eller innsikt i nye sp\o rsm\aa l.},

We extend the risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework in order to deal with large state spaces and we also propose a set of features that seem relevant for achieving a good level of play. We evaluate our approach using a fixed heuristic opponent as a bench- mark, pitting our agents against human players online and comparing samples of our agents at dierent times of training.},

In this paper, we introduce the design of a multithreaded distributed runtime system. Efficiency and ease of parallel programming are the two primary goals.

For perfect information games with relatively low branching factor for their decision tree (such as Chess, Checkers etc.) and a highly accurate evaluation function, Alpha-Beta search proved to be far more efficient than Monte Carlo Tree Search. In recent years many new techniques have been developed to improve the efficiency of the Alpha-Beta tree, applied to a variety of scientific fields. This paper explores several techniques for increasing the efficiency of Alpha-Beta Search on the board game of Abalone while introducing some new innovative techniques that proved to be very effective. The main idea behind them is the incorporation of probabilistic features to the otherwise deterministic AlphaBeta search.},

Our setting is an alternative to classical multiarmed bandits which provide no contextual side information, and is also an alternative to contextual bandits which provide new context each individual trial. Multi-armed bandits with episode context can arise naturally, for example in computer Go where context is used to bias move decisions made by a multi-armed bandit algorithm.},

Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess1 and Go2, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems, the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. Here we present the MuZero algorithm, which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. The MuZero algorithm learns an iterable model that produces predictions relevant to planning: the action-selection policy, the value function and the reward. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games3\textemdash the canonical video game environment for testing artificial intelligence techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled4\textemdash the MuZero algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi\textemdash canonical environments for high-performance planning\textemdash the MuZero algorithm matched, without any knowledge of the game dynamics, the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm5 that was supplied with the rules of the game. A reinforcement-learning algorithm that combines a tree-based search with a learned model achieves superhuman performance in high-performance planning and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics.},

  abstract = {A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100\textendash 0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. Starting from zero knowledge and without human data, AlphaGo Zero was able to teach itself to play Go and to develop novel strategies that provide new insights into the oldest of games. To beat world champions at the game of Go, the computer program AlphaGo has relied largely on supervised learning from millions of human expert moves. David Silver and colleagues have now produced a system called AlphaGo Zero, which is based purely on reinforcement learning and learns solely from self-play. Starting from random moves, it can reach superhuman level in just a couple of days of training and five million games of self-play, and can now beat all previous versions of AlphaGo. Because the machine independently discovers the same fundamental principles of the game that took humans millennia to conceptualize, the work suggests that such principles have some universal character, beyond human bias.},

Most agents in literature have hand-crafted features and are often trained on datasets obtained from expert human play. We implement a self- play based algorithm using neural networks for policy estimation and Monte Carlo Tree Search for policy im- provement, with no input human knowledge that learns to play Othello. We evaluate our learning algorithm for 6x6 and 8x8 versions of the game of Othello. Our work is compared with random and greedy baselines, as well as a minimax agent that uses a hand-crafted scoring function, and achieves impressive results. Further, our agent for the 6x6 version of Othello easily outperforms humans when tested against it.},

  abstract = {AlphaZero has achieved impressive performance in deep reinforcement learning by utilizing an architecture that combines search and training of a neural network in self-play. Many researchers are looking for ways to reproduce and improve results for other games/tasks. However, the architecture is designed to learn from scratch, tabula rasa, accepting a cold-start problem in self-play. Recently, a warmstart enhancement method for Monte Carlo Tree Search was proposed to improve the self-play starting phase. It employs a fixed parameter I to control the warm-start length. Improved performance was reported in small board games. In this paper we present results with an adaptive switch method. Experiments show that our approach works better than the fixed I , especially for ''deep,'' tactical, games (Othello and Connect Four). We conjecture that the adaptive value for I is also influenced by the size of the game, and that on average I will increase with game size. We conclude that AlphaZero-like deep reinforcement learning benefits from adaptive rollout based warm-start, as Rapid Action Value Estimate did for rollout-based reinforcement learning 15 years ago.},

  abstract = {Recently, AlphaZero has achieved landmark results in deep reinforcement learning, by providing a single self-play architecture that learned three different games at super human level. AlphaZero is a large and complicated system with many parameters, and success requires much compute power and fine-tuning. Reproducing results in other games is a challenge, and many researchers are looking for ways to improve results while reducing computational demands. AlphaZero's design is purely based on self-play and makes no use of labeled expert data ordomain specific enhancements; it is designed to learn from scratch. We propose a novel approach to deal with this cold-start problem by employing simple search enhancements at the beginning phase of self-play training, namely Rollout, Rapid Action Value Estimate (RAVE) and dynamically weighted combinations of these with the neural network, and Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms (RHEA). Our experiments indicate that most of these enhancements improve the performance of their baseline player in three different (small) board games, with especially RAVE based variants playing strongly.},
