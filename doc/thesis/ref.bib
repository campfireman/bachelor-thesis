  abstract = {N\aa r Deepminds AlphaGo-program slo den menneskelige profesjonelle Go-spilleren Fan Hui i 2015 var dette et stort gjennombrudd for kunstig intelligens til spilling. Go hadde vist seg \aa{} motst\aa{} de teknikkene som lenge hadde sl\aa tt mennesker i spill som sjakk. Gjennom en nyskapende kombinasjon av dype nevrale nettverk, forsterkende l\ae ring og Monte Carlo-tres\o k ble Go endelig mestret. Kort tid etterp\aa{} kom AlphaGo Zero, som oppn\aa dde det samme ved \aa{} l\ae re utelukkende ved \aa{} spille mot seg selv, og AlphaZero, som generaliserte teknikken til andre spill. Dette arbeidet inneholder en n\o ye gjennomgang av disse systemene og arbeidet i feltet som ledet opp mot dem. Det g\aa r gjennom min egen implementasjon av denne teknikken og dens bruk i spillene Hex og Othello. Ved hjelp av denne implementasjonen har jeg unders\o kt rollen utrulling spiller i algoritmen. Dette var en sentral del av tidligere arbeid i feltet og fremdeles brukt i AlphaGo, men ikke i AlphaGo Zero og AlphaZero. Flere eksperimenter har blitt gjennomf\o rt for \aa{} f\aa{} empiriske data for om utrulling fremdeles kan v\ae re en gunstig del av denne nyskapende kombinasjonen av teknikker, og hvordan disse i s\aa{} fall b\o r gjennomf\o res. Selv om det var noen indikasjoner i dataene p\aa{} at utrulling har liten eller ingen positiv effect er disse resultatene stort sett ikke entydige. Noen svakheter i oppsettet har blitt identifisert og noen nye sp\o rsm\aa l har blitt oppdaget. Men arbeidet har resultert i et funksjonelt system som kan brukes til videre unders\o kelser av problemomr\aa det og enten gi mer entydige data eller innsikt i nye sp\o rsm\aa l.},

Our approach is based on a reinforcement learning algorithm that is risk- seeking, since defensive players in Abalone tend to never end a game. We extend the risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework in order to deal with large state spaces and we also propose a set of features that seem relevant for achieving a good level of play. We evaluate our approach using a fixed heuristic opponent as a bench- mark, pitting our agents against human players online and comparing samples of our agents at dierent times of training.},

Like many variations of the Elo rating system, the whole-history approach is based on the dynamic Bradley-Terry model. But, instead of using incremental approximations, WHR directly computes the exact maximum a posteriori over the whole rating history of all players. This additional accuracy comes at a higher computational cost than traditional methods, but computation is still fast enough to be easily applied in real time to large-scale game servers (a new game is added in less than 0.001 second). Experiments demonstrate that, in comparison to Elo, Glicko, TrueSkill, and decayed-history algorithms, WHR produces better predictions.},

Tree search is central to solving a variety of problems in artificial intelligence and an important subset of the irregular applications where tasks are frequently created and terminated. In this paper, we introduce the design of a multithreaded distributed runtime system. Efficiency and ease of parallel programming are the two primary goals. In our system, multithreading is used to specify the asynchronous behavior in parallel game tree search, and dynamic load balancing is employed for efficient performance.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called ``dropout'' that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

In recent years many new techniques have been developed to improve the efficiency of the Alpha-Beta tree, applied to a variety of scientific fields. This paper explores several techniques for increasing the efficiency of Alpha-Beta Search on the board game of Abalone while introducing some new innovative techniques that proved to be very effective. The main idea behind them is the incorporation of probabilistic features to the otherwise deterministic AlphaBeta search.},

In this work, we suggest novel modifications of the AlphaZero algorithm to support multiplayer environments, and evaluate the approach in two simple 3-player games. Our experiments show that multiplayer AlphaZero learns successfully and consistently outperforms a competing approach: Monte Carlo tree search. These results suggest that our modified AlphaZero can learn effective strategies in multiplayer game scenarios. Our work supports the use of AlphaZero in multiplayer games and suggests future research for more complex environments.},

Our setting is an alternative to classical multiarmed bandits which provide no contextual side information, and is also an alternative to contextual bandits which provide new context each individual trial. Multi-armed bandits with episode context can arise naturally, for example in computer Go where context is used to bias move decisions made by a multi-armed bandit algorithm.},

We introduce Player of Games, a general-purpose algorithm that unifies previous approaches, combining guided search, self-play learning, and game-theoretic reasoning. Player of Games is the first algorithm to achieve strong empirical performance in large perfect and imperfect information games -- an important step towards truly general algorithms for arbitrary environments. We prove that Player of Games is sound, converging to perfect play as available computation time and approximation capacity increases. Player of Games reaches strong performance in chess and Go, beats the strongest openly available agent in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker (Slumbot), and defeats the state-of-the-art agent in Scotland Yard, an imperfect information game that illustrates the value of guided search, learning, and game-theoretic reasoning.},

Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100\textendash 0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. Starting from zero knowledge and without human data, AlphaGo Zero was able to teach itself to play Go and to develop novel strategies that provide new insights into the oldest of games. To beat world champions at the game of Go, the computer program AlphaGo has relied largely on supervised learning from millions of human expert moves. David Silver and colleagues have now produced a system called AlphaGo Zero, which is based purely on reinforcement learning and learns solely from self-play. Starting from random moves, it can reach superhuman level in just a couple of days of training and five million games of self-play, and can now beat all previous versions of AlphaGo. Because the machine independently discovers the same fundamental principles of the game that took humans millennia to conceptualize, the work suggests that such principles have some universal character, beyond human bias.},

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \^athinned\^a networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

  abstract = {AlphaZero has achieved impressive performance in deep reinforcement learning by utilizing an architecture that combines search and training of a neural network in self-play. Many researchers are looking for ways to reproduce and improve results for other games/tasks. However, the architecture is designed to learn from scratch, tabula rasa, accepting a cold-start problem in self-play. Recently, a warmstart enhancement method for Monte Carlo Tree Search was proposed to improve the self-play starting phase. It employs a fixed parameter I to control the warm-start length. Improved performance was reported in small board games. In this paper we present results with an adaptive switch method. Experiments show that our approach works better than the fixed I , especially for ''deep,'' tactical, games (Othello and Connect Four). We conjecture that the adaptive value for I is also influenced by the size of the game, and that on average I will increase with game size. We conclude that AlphaZero-like deep reinforcement learning benefits from adaptive rollout based warm-start, as Rapid Action Value Estimate did for rollout-based reinforcement learning 15 years ago.},

  abstract = {Recently, AlphaZero has achieved landmark results in deep reinforcement learning, by providing a single self-play architecture that learned three different games at super human level. AlphaZero is a large and complicated system with many parameters, and success requires much compute power and fine-tuning. Reproducing results in other games is a challenge, and many researchers are looking for ways to improve results while reducing computational demands. AlphaZero's design is purely based on self-play and makes no use of labeled expert data ordomain specific enhancements; it is designed to learn from scratch. We propose a novel approach to deal with this cold-start problem by employing simple search enhancements at the beginning phase of self-play training, namely Rollout, Rapid Action Value Estimate (RAVE) and dynamically weighted combinations of these with the neural network, and Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms (RHEA). Our experiments indicate that most of these enhancements improve the performance of their baseline player in three different (small) board games, with especially RAVE based variants playing strongly.},
