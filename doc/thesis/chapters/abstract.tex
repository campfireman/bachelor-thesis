AlphaGo's victory against Lee Sedol in the game of Go has been a milestone in artificial intelligence. After this success the team behind the program further refined the architecture and applied it to many other games such as chess or shogi. In the following thesis we try to apply the theory behind AlphaGo and its sucessor AlphaZero to the game of Abalone. Due to limitations in computational resources we could not replicate the same exceptional performance.
