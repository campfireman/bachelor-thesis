\chapter{Introduction}

Programming is severely limited by our ability to properly model the problem in advance. Problems with large complexity would require large efforts, that at a certain point just become unfeasable. Instead, learning the task from a blank slate, \emph{tablula rasa}, would allow to imitate human adaptability.

    Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the childâ€™s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain. Presumably the child-brain is something like a note-book as one buys it from the stationers. Rather little mechanism, and lots of blank sheets. [...] Our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child-brain that something like it can be easily programmed.
